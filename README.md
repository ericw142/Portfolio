# ResponsivePortfolio
Homework Assignment due Saturday, August 29, 2020 11:59 PM


For this assignment, I created a portfolio website with three pages. All elements are responsive, meaning whatever screen size you use to view the website, they will resize for readability and ease of use. Each page is created with bootstrap styling and the bootstrap grid system, so content is organized within containers, rows and columns. I placed certain elements, such as the jumbotron, outside of these on purpose for my own style preferences. I also used two fonts, the Julius and Ubunto Sans Serif font families.
